Quarter 4 Project - Serie A Standings Simulator

-UPDATED LAST 11:00 AM - 5/7/24-


a) I will make a list containing all of the team names in the league - it will be put in a formated standings chart using real life data. (pretty much done ✔️)

b) Then I will make a way to import results into the spredsheet to make the chart change.

a) I have been learning to use the data frame, Pandas, through online toterial videos and using W3Schools (from 4/24-current). I finished learning by 5/1. (pretty much done ✔️) 

b) I will learn to used a CSV reader after the chart has been developed through the CSV data frame, Pandas (WORKING ON). I am currently trying to figure out a way to fully import a spreadsheet of data into my code. 

c) I will code a way to import results into the chart/spreadsheet, altering the chart visual/statistics.

1. The Chart is going to be done by May 1st (done ✔️) - need to learn and develop a chart with CSV spreadsheets import. 
2. The new data from a excel spreadsheet will be imported into the chart by May 10th (changing the prior chart) ◀️ (This is going to change - not sure if I am doing my project w/ this step)
3. The feature of creating a way to continusely import data will be done by End of May to early June
